1. To install a "PERL" follow this link : https://learn.perl.org/installing/
2. As for the SQLite i found this is the best place to follow : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm
3. To configure your Apache to execute cgi, follow this link : https://perlmaven.com/perl-cgi-script-with-apache2.
(Check if you have multiple apaches)
4. Install required modules for your PERL

Run connect.pl from simpleperl/cgi-bin/backend/initial
Run table.pl from simpleperl/cgi-bin/backend/initial

PS: Keep in mind that if you are using MAC, Perl and SQLite are already installed in the system.

cgi-bin folder contains all neccesary cgi files. As for this instance i have stored all .pl and .cgi files inside backend.

All scripts and html are in the index.html
